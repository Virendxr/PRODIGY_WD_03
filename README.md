# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe Web Game  
A classic Tic Tac Toe web game rebuilt with a modern UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to play against a random AI opponent with a smooth interface, ambient background visuals, and interactive sound effects.

# 📝 Overview  
This game lets players choose between X or O, then face off against a computer that selects random empty cells. The game handles win/draw logic, updates UI dynamically, and offers a synthwave-style background with audio feedback for clicks and restarts. It’s fully responsive and designed with a sleek dark theme.

All logic is written in vanilla JavaScript, including cell tracking, win condition checks, AI random move logic, and UI animations. CSS is used for transitions, player highlighting, and responsive design. The HTML is clean and structured for accessibility and clarity.
